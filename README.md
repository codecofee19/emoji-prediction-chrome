# very early beta, maybe even alpha! 

Gives emoji predictions based on your input into a text field.

This is an extension for Chrome that provides emoji predictions. As you type into a input field, 
a small popup should appear below the text entry input with a guessed emoji. Then upon pressing the hotkey
(currently Ctrl + Shft) the emoji will replace the last word.

Please feel free to get involved as finding time can be so hard, the more the merrier! :-)
